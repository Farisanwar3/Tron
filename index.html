It takes place in a robot factory that has a Tron-feel to it.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
In the near future, there are robots that go to people's houses and murder them for various crimes, 

such as political beliefs.  The crimes are something as simple as political backlash and inflammatory 

speech on the internet. Freedom of speech does not exist anymore.  The United States has become as 

totalitarian government. The National Security Agency, FBI, and the Navy Seals have been building robots 

that could search "criminal's" houses and perform justice on them.  You are this person who has a grudge 

against the U.S. government and decided enough was enough.  You wish to bring back the United States to 

where it was been 30 years, living in more peace and less violence and anarchy.  The murder rate from these 

robots has increased severely over the past four years.  Even, these robots have killed many children.  And 

yes, most schools and institutions were being shut down because of these robots.  So, the United States is 

in a state of emergency.  Your job is to change it from a state of emergency to a state of progress.  You 

are being transferred to a tron-like facility that builds these bad robots.  You decide to bring some 

robots to trial over there and try to kill them so that other robots being built in that facility will 

develop amicability and thus become more friendly with human beings.  You hang the bad robots from the 

ceiling of the factory.  You are on a Tron-like motorcycle and try to destroy all these robots from the 

ceiling with a ball that explodes them on impact.  But, the average human being is only able to receive 32 

hits from the ball until he or she becomes paralyzed and will end up at the hospital to become 

rescucitated.  The politics and the overall situation of the United States will become better.  On the flip 

side, if you kill all these bad robots in the factory, you get to restore the government of the United 

States and the President will sign a peace treaty for the population of the United States.
